# NGO-Impact-Analysis
Hands-on opportunity to explore how data-driven insights can direct and enhance humanitarian efforts.

GoodThought NGO has been a catalyst for positive change, focusing its efforts on education, healthcare, and sustainable development to make a significant difference in communities worldwide. With this mission, GoodThought has orchestrated an array of assignments aimed at uplifting underprivileged populations and fostering long-term growth.

This project offers a hands-on opportunity to explore how data-driven insights can direct and enhance these humanitarian efforts. I use the GoodThought PostgreSQL database in this project, which encapsulates detailed records of assignments, funding, impacts, and donor activities from 2010 to 2023. This comprehensive dataset includes:

* Assignments: Details about each project, including its name, duration (start and end dates), budget, geographical region, and impact_score.
* Donations: Records of financial contributions linked to specific donors and assignments, highlighting how financial support is allocated and utilized.
* Donors: Information on individuals and organizations that fund GoodThoughtâ€™s projects, including donor types.

The aim is to execute SQL queries to answer:
1. NGO project assignments by donation amount, region and donation type. 
2. Which projects have a high impact score, and how many donations by region?
